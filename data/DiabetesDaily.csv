0,Starting transition from mdi to pump,10/20/2022,Dennis 48,"My healthcare transfered my diabetes care from primary care doctor to a pharmacist. Didn't work out very well for me. The pharmacist and I butted heads over corrections. She thought my Humalog should only be taken with meals. Corrections were too dangerous and would lead to hypoglycemia. I have been doing corrections for years without hypoglycemia. I basically blew her off and and told her she was full of ****. As punishment I was sent to a diabetic educator to be straightened out. After the educator and I talk, she reported back to my primary care and pharmacist that I was doing an outstanding job managing my diabetes. My time in range has consistently been 80 - 90% on my Dexcom. To my surprise she said that I would be a perfect candidate for a pump. After my referal to the Endocrinologists I now have a Tandem t:slim X-2 and will start my training next week. After all the hassle I went through to get my CMG I never thought this 73 year old type 2 would be considered for a pump. Medicare even paid 80%of the cost.","The CGM has been a great tool.

1,Closed-loop Pump Recommendations,09/20/2022,dnamertz1,"I have been using the t-slim/Dexcom closed loop system with Control IQ. My pump warranty period just ended but the pump still works well. I love Control IQ and the accuracy of the Dexcom CGM, but ever since Dexcom made a change to the adhesive on their sensors about two years ago I get terrible red bumpy rashes in the exact shape of the adhesive. Many other people reported the exact same problem around that same time. I’ve tried all the solutions, and the only thing that works is to put a thicker adhesive underneath the sensor, but that adhesive does not stick very well so I am always struggling to get it to stay on all 10 days. So, I am considering making a change but I would like opinions (pros and cons) from users of other closed loop systems. I used a Medtronic CGM many years ago but the accuracy was not good. I don’t know if they have improved that.",Have you seen any of the previous discussions? Maybe some of these would be of interest until some members respond.,"Well, I’ll just add my experience. I had Dexcom CGM a few years ago, before I got a pump. Until, I put the sensors on my upper arms, I didn’t have reliable, consistent BG numbers with Dexcom. I’d be off 100 points from my meter at any random time. But, it improved when I switched to using my arms. Soon after, I got Medtronic 670G pump and CGM. For me, the GGMs ran about the same as Dexcom on my BG. I actually wore both at one time for a couple of weeks during my transition to Medtronic so I know how close they ran.","I switched from Medtronic to Dexcom relatively recently and have litle to no issue with adhesion with either I perhaps find the dexcom marginally better, but that could be my own ""honeymoon period"" with the new sensor (albeit it now 6 months +).

2,"Medicare, C-Peptide, Type 2 Pump",11/13/2021,williamtd,"I’m Type 2 and have been on a pump for years. It’s the only thing that controls my A1c. I have pump and Dexcom supplies for the next 3 months, but after that, I’ll need to get more. I haven’t seen my Endo since 2020 because I've been uninsured prior to starting Medicare a few weeks ago. The Endo I was seeing isn’t covered by my Medicare plan, so I’ll be making a new appt as well and getting re-established with a new Endo prior to attempting to get a new pump (out of warranty now) and supplies. I’ve never had a C-Peptide test before. I know that I need a C-Peptide test to qualify for a pump under Medicare. Medicare's criteria states: “…a fasting C-peptide level that is less than or equal to 110 percent of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory’s measurement method.” So, if the C-Peptide range for the specific lab I’ll be using is “0.80 to 3.85 ng/mL” does that mean that my C-Peptide would have to be less than or equal to .088 ng/mL? Lower limit of normal is “.08 ng/mL” on this range, multiplied by “.110” (110%)…would equal “.088 ng/mL.” Did I do that math correctly? Thanks for any help!","Your answer (.088) is correct but your multiplier is not (.110 is off by a decimal point, 1.10 is the correct number). I am not sure how you arrived at the correct answer. The correct calculation is: .08 X 1.10 = .088","After thinking about it, I think C peptide is a better indicator of basal insulin level just because it is metabolized more slowly than insulin.

The amount of the micro blouses increases if your BGs start to elevate and are suspended if your sensor predicts (not when) you are going low. However, the micro blouses max out at 0.175 /5 minutes.

I am desperately awaiting the 780G upgrade, which lowers the target point, along with other, more aggressive changes! The 770G is just to conservative. The way I see it, my A1C is about 0.5% higher due to this ""margin of safety."," A target of 120 is always better than averaging 130 or 140, but those numbers still equate to a great A1c. If you were sitting in the ER for 7 hours, that alone could cause stress and you know what stress can do to BG levels. Keep up the good work and, eventually, the 780g will be FDA approved.

They’ve made enough mistakes on their own.",Target will still be to have average at 6.5 mmol/L = 94 mg/dL or less . what is this 140 ? Looks to me that someone is chicken to lower the set point. I would be very unhappy with such a high set point.,"Medtronic goes through cycles of this. They seem to think that they know best (such a paternalistic attitude). I remember I traded my new 515 to go back to my 512. The newer pump would not let me change the time for active insulin (it was hard coded as 4 hours). That didn't work for me and I was expected to fudge my I:C calculations to make things work. And I couldn't use the bolus wizard because of this either.

I use omnipod, and really don’t know how to determine waste. I assume the alarm works on the same principle as the other pumps - out of insulin, pressure builds up as delivery mechanism tries to work, and then the alarm saying empty reservoir, but I have no idea how to even determine that.

7,My pump improved my time in range.,06-01-2022,zeegirl,"I'm not sure I've posted, in forever, but felt like I needed to say this to anyone who is weighing getting an insulin pump. I have a Tandem T:slim with IQ control. I resisted getting a pump, for several years, for several reasons. The main one being I didn't want something attached to my body to have to deal with daily. I had worn a Free Style Libre CGM for a long time. My numbers were up and down constantly. My daughter, finally, made me see the error of my ways and I bit the bullet and got my pump. It took some time to learn everything but I read everything I could find and am pretty comfortable with the pump now. I've changed from a Free Style Libre to a Dex Com 7 CGM because that's what Tandem uses. Just let me say that I'm over the moon with my numbers. My target glucose limit is set at 70-180. I started out with 75% as my daily time in range goal, increased it to 80% and am now at 85%. Believe it or not, my time in range ranges from 89 to 100% all the time. ","How nice to hear! Wishing you continued success with it. I sometimes resist some of the ""new-fangled"" stuff, too, though once you get the hang of something, it's usually pretty great.

There are several things I read I don’t like and things I do like. The 780 will have the G4 and I think calibration is once a week or no calibration. Having a hard time deciding but I have few months to decide just hate to be stuck with a pump that I don’t like for 4years ,"I;m on the 770G, patiently awaiting the 780 approval.

21,Pump advice Canada,04/15/2018,jodoog,"Hey, I'm sure this gets asked a lot but was hoping for some pump-choice advice.
I'm a Type 1 (23 years roughly) located in Canada and recently started using a Dexcom G5 with Xdrip+; which I'm appreciating so far (minus the interstitial delay). I've decided to go ahead with a pump as it's mostly covered here in Ontario. Really struggling trying to decide between the Omnipod, and waiting a few months for the T:Slim x2. It mainly seems to be a case of G5 integration vs tubeless but it's hard to value either given I've never used a pump before (novorapid + tresiba atm).
For those that have used either pump do you have any suggestions? Is the G5 integration on the Tandem particularly useful? The PLGS Tandem system sounds like it could be fantastic given the number of hypos I have - assuming it's ever brought to Canadian T-slims.
For reference my last HbA1c was 5.4. However I currently use a lot of insulin and an enormous amount of sugar to aggressively ping-pong my blood sugar into a 4-7 range. My insulin sensitivity seems to change significantly day-by-day; however I feel awful when my BS exits that range and try to avoid it at all costs (although it happens plenty).
Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks! :)","Before my transplant I had a medtronic pump that I loved. But last year at FFL (friends for life T1 conference) I saw so many pods I decided that when it was time to pump again that I would have a serious look at the pod.

You should search for the 670g as there are several threads that discuss this product.

In theory, you should only be required to do a BG test every twelves hours. However, there are situations where you need to do additional BG testing. Apparently. The FDA requires that you need to do a BG test if you remain under 120 for 2.5 hours. There also seems to be other situations for which a BG test is required to remain in auto mode. For some reason I had to do 3 BG test within an hour today.

26,Hard to lose weight on the pump?,03-05-2018,millie275,Is it hard to loose weight on the pump? What adjustments need to be made to loose weight? Im guessing the basal will go down as well as total amount of bolus as you eat less? But trial and error the first time?,Hi Millie I think it depends on total dose per day.,"A pump is just a tool. Some folks gain weight, because they see a pump as an ""easy out"", and just eat more and press buttons. Some lose weight, but only because the tool gives them more control and flexibility.

One thing a pump does do is allow you to be more spontaneous regarding exercise and/or food restriction. If, for example, you suddenly decide to go for a longer walk than normal, you can cut your basal rate temporarily. And, if a more vigorous session than normal makes you even more insulin-sensitive for a while, you can also reduce or even suspend insulin delivery, rather than treating a hypo or near-hypo with carbs. Likewise, if you decide to eat less, and if it drives you low despite your best basal testing, you can also cut your basal for a while.

I've been on a pump for 5 years, and a CGM for almost 3 years, and I'm just now getting into the habit of cutting my basal if I see my Ng heading towards the low end of my range. Old habits (reaching for a small snack or swig of OJ) are hard to break.

I don't look at it as a pump helping to lose weight, so much as I look at MDI as making it very difficult. The way I see it, the pump just brings us back to a level playing field. From there, it's the same hard work as for everyone else out there. But, after years of fighting an uphill battle, it sure is nice to be fighting on that level field.","I agree with what Peter is saying. If you use your pump as an easy way to eat all and everything, then you would put on weight. Without a doubt it is easy to go for seconds with a pump as you just do some more button presses and eat away. It is also easy to reach for a snack.

However, for me the pump has helped me maintain my weight. When I first started on insulin using MDI I could not bolus small enough for what I wanted to eat, so I would end up having to eat a bit more to cover the 0.5 unit which was the smallest amount a demi-pen would allow. With my pump if I want to eat something that only requires 0.1u then that is what I have.

As Peter says the pump is just another tool for delivering your insulin and it is up to you how you are going to use it.",03-08-2018,3,16,Negative,"{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.097, 'compound': -0.5409}",0.010429703796412181,-0.5409,-0.755,0.0,-0.9684,0.9275,0.0,0.0392156862745098,0.010218978102189781,0.01174934725848564,2397

I wouldn't mine waiting so much if they said the truth about the delays. To me that is not a good way to keep customers.

31,Setting basal tricky?,02-10-2018,CalgaryDiabetic,"A least in theory you should be able to set your basal so you stay in the normal range 70 to 110 between meals. Well I set mine at somewhere close to 3 units/hr and sometimes I go low and most of the time above 130. Since 130 to 150 is a lot less unpleasant than low I leave it at that and correct a bit. after correction I go low sometimes. I am not sure what changes from day to day I know food: composition and CALORIES do matter, sleep, exercise all have effects and God only knows what else: for instance gum infection. when I started pumping I did better with an average of 7 mmol/L i.e. 125 and with a variance that was only that you would expect from the meter. When I first got the pump I may have been more more careful about food and eating a bit less calories.

This would be the ideal application for closed loop control. My pump does not allow for that. Will be entitled to exchange it for medtronics 630 (when the Animas supplies are no longer available)which I think doesn't do that. Maybe for more money I could get more advanced medtronics with some feedback control.

What do you pump magicians think ?","CD I hear you loud and clear. My basal challenges occur during the night. Even though my 640G (& maybe the 603?) isn't closed loop, at least it does suspend basal if approaching a low. As lows are my main problem, I love this feature.

I now have my night time basal set to 0.5. With my old Veo some days I would wake up perfect and other I'd wake with a nasty hypo. I'd often have to make a judgement call before going to bed as to whether I'd have to drop it to 0.45 or even lower, depending upon how the day had been panning out.

Now with my 640G I wake up refreshed & rested and can often see that my basal got suspended & then restarted while I slept on blissfully unaware.","CD, how many basal rates do you have? I had 3. My highest was from midnight to 6 am, lowest from 6 am to 11 am and then the mid range one from 11 am to midnight. But my insulin sensitivity was pretty stable. What were the results of your basal testing and do you think it's time to do a it more testing? I hated checking the overnight levels getting up every hour or two. Skipping meals for half the day was less of a deal for me to figure out my daytime rates.

Cora","Thank you Caraline, this is good to know that basal is very touchy, same with me but at a 6 times rate a 10% change in basal has massive effect. suspend and restart is a great feature one can then be much more aggressive with basal without waking up because of a nasty low. So 640 G. I am not sure our health care covers CGM sensors and tax deduction for medical supplies is next to useless. I will ask medtronics what they charge for CGM sensors and what the capital cost is also.

32,Bolus wizard,02/17/2018,bradpollina,"So I went back to my CDE Thursday and as promised, she went over all the menus of the 630G pump.

We turned on the BOLUS wizard, and she said it is a work in progress and that I can call any time for adjustments.
Based upon my Dexcom #s, she set it at Carb ratio of 5, ISF 15 and 100-120 low high and active insulin time at 4 hours. My current basal is 2 units per hour.

For carbs, I'm using One Drop's food library to calculate carbs (my choice. I actually love it!).

Do you recommend that I test via finger stick to put in the BG level at each meal, or should I just leave that blank? She said if I put a BG level in there, it would take my current level into account and adjust accordingly so I don't go too high or low.

For now she wants me to work on consistency and not going low and to use the wizard as much as I can.

So far I've been doing ok staying around 140 but occasionally it goes a bit high. I go back in about 4 weeks.

We also covered the waves, and she said square was for extended boluses over time like for Pizza and that the dual wave was 2 separate boluses split up over

I'm also on Bydurion BCISE weekly. Having fun on the prior authorization merry go round but once that's approved, it wont cost me anything (nor will my insulin and all diabetic products btw so long as I stay on the preferred list like Humalog vs Novolog anyway).

I also asked about type 1.5 vs 2 and was told that so long as I'm still producing ANY insulin that I would be a type 2. But she did say that if I ever became a type 1 I could still continue my Bcise because it helps with both 1 and 2 so not a whole lot would change for me.",Not sure I agree at all with he definition 1.5 even some type 1 produce some insulin.,"Oh, I'm sure I disagree with the CDE.

As T1 is an Auto-immune disorder, whether sudden, or slow onset, and T2 is not AI, one does not go from T2 to T1, period.

Not to beat a dead horse, but I really believe you should not just ""let this go"", because, moving forward, the difference between a proper T1 diagnosis and not can have a major impact with various insurance coverages, especially eventual Medicare. And if you think it's difficult to get the proper classification now, it certainly will only be more difficult as time goes by.","As far as testing before using the Wizard, yes, the Wizard works best if you can enter your current Bg. When you do, it can build a correction (positive or negative, depending on if you are above or below your target range) into the calculations.

Also, your 630G should have come with a Next Link meter. This is where the radio link of the Next Link is so nice. It just sends the Bg value right to the pump, right into the Wizard. Yes, it's just a matter of saving a few seconds, but time savers like that sure encourage actually testing each time.

When you don't test, the Wizard leaves the Correction portion out. In essence, it assumes your Bg is right where you want it, and calculates, as best it can, to return your Bg right to where it is at the moment, PP.

Can the sensor be stuck in the stomach area ?","Actually, the abdomen is the recommended placement for the Medtronic CGM's (Enlite/Guardian 3).","	""That is good news. I am changing my opinion on the usefulness of CGM in my case since they seem to be getting more accurate and could be good for slight adjustments of basal at night to permit normal BG without lows that often.

Had to change my Dexcom, so at my first meal, which was a 1/2 piece of chicken breast and 1/2 cup of peas in a pod, I bolused 25 units in my 630G pump and didn't check my BS before eating. Bad idea!

I went way low, like 55, and my vision went wonky and I got all shakey. I've never been this low before!

You duplicate your 'Normal' profile, and then edit basal rates in each time entry of the new profile (typically 3 or 4 entries) with the new value [example: old value * .7 = new value for norm70], and save each entry.

Omnipod training tomorrow...suggestions?",11-05-2018,bradpollina,"Tomorrow I'm getting trained on my Omnipod by my diabetic educator.
I've already had formal training on my 630G from Medtronic, so looks very similar.
I've already programmed it myself and have been using it for a few weeks or so, and so far 
I don't have any questions other than needing help figuring out locations and making sure I'm 
inserting it right. I've also noticed that the canula seems to be a bit wider/bigger, so it tends to cause sore spots?
I also don't like that with the amount of insulin I have to take, I have to change it every 2 days.
Any suggestions as to what I should ask her that maybe I'm not thinking of?","i never took the training, i would like to know why the math doesnt add up correctly on how much insulin is left.. example by the pdm i will have used 160ish units by the end of the cycle, yet it will show 9 or 10 units or low","I can't speak for the OmniPod specifically, but did you account for any insulin used to ""prime"" the pod? Also, on my Medtronic pump, there's always about 10 units left when the staus says Zero. I assume it's a safety margin of error.","Training went well. My trainer downloaded the report and said I'm using 200 units, which includes priming waste, about every 1.5 days, so she had my doc's nurse call in a dosage change to 1 pod per day. Insurance had no problems with that at all. I think it is only 200 vs 300 units because it is big enough of a pod. 300 would make it even larger! I love how it's all self contained.

Since reusing the infusion set, I experienced Difficulty keeping my BGs below 200 even using a number of bolus corrections. I also noticed that I was using just over100 units of insulin a day instead of my usual 65 units.

My question is whether the high BGs were most likely due to keeping the infusion set in place for a second three days or more likely due to my cold?n","Infusion sets don’t last forever. Do a correction dose with a syringe. If it lowers your number, the infusion set is done. When in doubt, change it out. But it also sounds like you have nothing to change it out to.","Yes, keeping the infusion set in that long causes blood glucose to rise. To reuse an infusion set, you pull it out after 3-4 days, put it in somewhere else and stick the canula fitting down with adhesive tape. That way you can get another 3-4 days use out of it.

70,Medtronic Reservoir Reuse,02-07-2018,,"Just found an approved supplier for insulin pump supplies under my New United HeLthcare Group Medicare Advantage policy. Unfortunately my last reservoir is scheduled to be empty on Friday (long story). Accordingly, there is no way I will receive a shipment in time.

Medtronic is in the process of replacing a defective reservoir but is currently out of stock of individual reservoirs. Does anyone know if I can refil the old reservoir to hold me over until my new supply is received?",I have an animas ping and do refill reservoirs on occasion. I pump at least 75 units/day so one fill does not last long.,"I think it's okay to re-use it. Not for a long long time or too many times though, the O-ring will likely degrade.

Most of the time I refill the reservoir once, and use a set for a combined 4 days, then use a fresh set & reservoir. I've never had a problem.

In faxt, since a vial holds 1000 units, and after three fills, there's still 100 units left, if I'm having a particularly cooperative set, I sometimes will use that last 100 units by refilling the reservoir again, using the set for almost five days. But I try not to make a habit of that.

71,Pump question,10/19/2018,,"Hi, I was just diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, but I'm not insulin dependent yet, for the time being, meds have been working.

I know technology has come along way, but I know nothing about insulin pumps. Can a pump read your blood sugar and deliver insulin automatically? If that's a ridiculous question, forgive me. I know you can wear a sensor on your arm instead of sticking your finger, so I'm wondering if somehow the sensor/reader can work automatically with the pump.

Thanks for any input.

Lisa","You can pair up a pump and CGM to work together and use your Iphone with apps to have a system of both delivery, reporting/recording showing patterns. THe CGM can be set with thresholds with alarms for both high and low BG. Your pump can only use rapid acting insulin and you can set your basal to delivery x amount of unit(s) per hour and use it to deliver bolus for meals but that part of it you need to do manually. others here on forum can provide you more specifics on best pumps/cgm and the details using them. I elected to bypass a pump and use MDI as it works best for me","Since you have LADA, your ins plan should cover your pump and CGM/sensors but you may have co pymt/deductible. but right now your not on insulin so this is something you can research for a later date. you may want a Libre to monitor your BG, cheaper and easy to use or use a simple blood glucose meter and strips,

Has anyone gone from a Medtronics to Omnipod?

What did you think?

The only reservation I’m having is with the tubing, there is no way to misplace the pump but with this system there is! It also seems like it is much larger than the pocketable 630G.

83,Another Question Regarding Tandem T-Slim Pump,07/25/2018,,"I should get my new pump by Friday, or Monday at the latest. In a situation like I had tonight with my Medtronrc 723 pump.... I changed my set out this morning and filled with 300 cc of insulin. I have been fighting with hyperglycemia ever since. I tried exercising to get the blood flowing better, drinking liquids, extra bonuses to the point of stacking. Nothing seemed to help. My site felt a little tender, so I decided to start a new set-up. I took a new infusion set, and only added back the insulin I used and changed everything out. I can often use that much insulin in 3 days, but sometimes I get an extra full day with it. With the Tandem pump, would the 260 units of insulin be wasted that was left from the set-up this morning? Can I use that reseviour for the second set up in less than 12 hours, or is there a way to get that insulin out of that reseviour? I can not afford to waste insulin. Right now I am in the Medicare gap and having to pay for all my meds. That already takes more than I bring in each month. I am going with the metal infusion set with the new pump. My cannula was bent tonight when I got it out to examine.","You don't have to change the reservoir when you change the infusion set. Use the reservoir until it is empty. I change infusion sets and reservoirs independently. I refill reservoirs 4 or 5 times before throwing it out, so they last about a month. I also reuse steel cannula infusion sets.","I swap sites every 2-3 days, but only swap cartridges when they're empty (typically 8-9 days).

So a cartridge will last 3-4 sets. Got in this habit with my Spirit pump with no issues, and continue with the Tandem.","Thanks for the replies. I find that the Medtronic cartridge leaks pretty good if used for more than 3 days.

84,replacement pump,08/26/2018,,"I got a replacement for my Animas Vibe pump today. After 3 years of use I was having difficulty reading the screen. I thought my sight was deteriorating. But at the diabetes clinic I was told that the pump was not working properly and should be replaced. The new Vibe arrived at my home in a remote New Zealand town the next day. Works much better and should last me at least another 3 years. This is the first time I have asked for assistance with the pump, and I am very impressed.",That's great!

85,Medtronic 670 Too Expensive!,06-11-2018,,"Has anyone else using a Medtronic 670 pump run into them being crazy expensive to use? We knew they were costly but seems like they are to expensive to even own?
Thinking of sending mine back and switching back to the needles, alot cheaper to use.
Not to mention the constant beeping and loss of sleep from the thing always needing calibration!
Just looking for a few different ideas.","If you are on a Medicare Group Advantage plan, It will cover the pump but not cover a Continuous Glucose Monitor System.","I am on regular Medicare and a supplement and all pumps are now covered, I have been pumping for a very long time and have not ever had any out of pocket costs. My health improved when I started pumping around 34 years ago. I have a CGM now and my a1c is improving with that, also. When you get comfortable with wearing a pump & CGM you will start to fine tune it, and some of those alarms will go away. There is absolutely nothing wrong with MDI, either. It`s all in what you are most comfortable with. Good luck in whatever you decide to do. Please post back as I am interested in what you decide to do.","I don't know that Medtronic systems are any more expensive than other brands.

For example, the only two true CGM systems, Dexcom and Medtronic, are pretty much the same as far as costs. Some save with Dex by reusing their sensors longer, but that is ""off-label"". And, even at that, the transmitters for Medtronic are rechargeable, and may prove cheaper than Dexcom's over their life cycle. So, all in all, they're pretty even.

As far as pumps, they all have significant up front costs. I don't know if any current brand (Medtronic, Tandam, Insulet) are significantly cheaper than the others. The same goes for the supplies, such as infusion sets, reservoirs, or Pods.

Again, are you commenting on Medtronic in particular, or on the costs associated with Pumping and CGM's in general?",06/14/2018,3,19,Positive,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.167, 'compound': 0.9956}",0.005804749340369393,0.9956,-0.3076,0.128,0.9756,0.891,0.0026041666666666665,0.0,0.013223140495867768,0.002544529262086514,1895
86,Opinions please,07/20/2018,stew7428,"d a new insulin pump thru tandem about a week ago. What is their process to send it after insurances are verified? Does all this go pretty quickly? My supply company has called to verify next month's order and I really don't want to run out, but don't want to delay getting supplies for the new one either. I hope I made the right decision when going with tandem. It was between them and omni-pod. My hubby was 100% for tandem and I was torn between the two. I know that I am the one wearing i, but after 44 years of marriage, you talk things thru. I have scheloderma and have decided that it is time for the metal canulas instead of the plastic. I have not been using an insertor or metal cannula with my Medtronic, but I am having more frequent bent infusion sets. I would love no tubing, but need the metal at this time in my life. Maybe in another 5 years, that will be an option. Thanks for reading my long post and would appreciate your opinions, please.",Currently use mdi. Tried the tslim for two days at the friends for life conference last week. Very likely going to get one at end of the year. Very impressed! The steel set is the one I tried was very comfortable. I agree they won't bend and should give a full length of time! Too bad omni pod only has one type of canula. They also are great to use and work with.,"Thanks furball and Red fan. I am excited and can't wait for it to come in. Anyone wanting an insulin pump these days will have to have a C-Peptide and fasting glucose under 200 on the same day to satisfy most insurances, including Medicare. I have an old one but had lots of trouble running it down. I had 2 docs that have retired by now. Luckily, records were forwarded on to my PCP. I thought the endo would have it, but didn't. I thought I would mention that, hopefully it will help someone along the way. Anyone remember their results?

87,Pump failures,07-05-2018,Sarirb1,To my freinds on pumps. Today I woke up with my CGM showing a normal glucose. Changed my infusion site went for a two mile walk. Blood glucose quickly rose to 250 despite my usual breakfast. This will happen about every 3 months and usually indicates that the pumps catheter is bent. It can then take most of the day ho get my sugar down. Does this happen to ogher pump users? Is there any way to prevent it? Would Fiasp or an insulin other than my Humalog help?,"I was having issues with any type of cannulas. Decided 5 years ago to switch to steel needle infusion sets and no issues except the usual site gets sore but less Highs
",If your cannula is bent then it indicates you have the wrong length/size or you need to try a different type or angled cannula.

89,Reviews on Medtronic MiniMed 670G system,02-05-2020,jeff1318,I have been on the Omnipod system for 10 years. I recently moved to Idaho and the state Medicaid does not have a provider that deals with the Omnipods. I am going to have to switch to a traditional pump. I am leaning toward the Medtronic MiniMed 670G system. I was hoping that I could get some pros and cons from those that have used it. Thank you. The information will be greatly appreciated.,"I have used Medtronic pumps (currently on 670 G) for eight years and never had an issue with the pumps and always got good service from Medtronic. When I accidentally went into the pool with oneof the old pumps, I had a replacement the next day.","Jeff, I'm new to a pump and started Medtronic 670G with Guardian CGM a little over a year ago. Before that, I had MDIs for almost 20 years. I used Dexcom G5 CGM for about 2 years prior. I'm probably not the best person to ask, because, I've never used the pump without a CGM and I suspect that my issue is with how the CGM works and not the pump.","I just saw on the news that the Medtronic 600 series, including 670G, has a warning for potential problem. It says to check and make sure the little ridges that hold the reservoir in place isn’t broken. I THINK mine is intact.....lol. They announced this same problem with older models months ago.
