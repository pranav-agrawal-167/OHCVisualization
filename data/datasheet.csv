Starting transition from mdi to pump,10/20/2022,Dennis 48,"My healthcare transfered my diabetes care from primary care doctor to a pharmacist. Didn't work out very well for me. The pharmacist and I butted heads over corrections. She thought my Humalog should only be taken with meals. Corrections were too dangerous and would lead to hypoglycemia. I have been doing corrections for years without hypoglycemia. I basically blew her off and and told her she was full of ****. As punishment I was sent to a diabetic educator to be straightened out. After the educator and I talk, she reported back to my primary care and pharmacist that I was doing an outstanding job managing my diabetes. My time in range has consistently been 80 - 90% on my Dexcom. To my surprise she said that I would be a perfect candidate for a pump. After my referal to the Endocrinologists I now have a Tandem t:slim X-2 and will start my training next week. After all the hassle I went through to get my CMG I never thought this 73 year old type 2 would be considered for a pump. Medicare even paid 80%of the cost.","The CGM has been a great tool. We are the same age, I wish yor successbb with the pump.",what good news for you! This sounds wonderful for you!,"Thats fantastic well done. I'm in Australia and whilst not understanding or pretending to understand the US system, the fact thct you had to be ""told"" and ""sent"" to others to assist in your obviously well controlled medical condition, says a lot of the tick and flick system! Glad you got what you wanted and needed in the end! PS i'm late 40's and only have mid 70's time in range so well done!",10/22/2022,2,8
Closed-loop Pump Recommendations,09/20/2022,dnamertz1,"I have been using the t-slim/Dexcom closed loop system with Control IQ. My pump warranty period just ended but the pump still works well. I love Control IQ and the accuracy of the Dexcom CGM, but ever since Dexcom made a change to the adhesive on their sensors about two years ago I get terrible red bumpy rashes in the exact shape of the adhesive. Many other people reported the exact same problem around that same time. I’ve tried all the solutions, and the only thing that works is to put a thicker adhesive underneath the sensor, but that adhesive does not stick very well so I am always struggling to get it to stay on all 10 days. So, I am considering making a change but I would like opinions (pros and cons) from users of other closed loop systems. I used a Medtronic CGM many years ago but the accuracy was not good. I don’t know if they have improved that.",Have you seen any of the previous discussions? Maybe some of these would be of interest until some members respond.,"Well, I’ll just add my experience. I had Dexcom CGM a few years ago, before I got a pump. Until, I put the sensors on my upper arms, I didn’t have reliable, consistent BG numbers with Dexcom. I’d be off 100 points from my meter at any random time. But, it improved when I switched to using my arms. Soon after, I got Medtronic 670G pump and CGM. For me, the GGMs ran about the same as Dexcom on my BG. I actually wore both at one time for a couple of weeks during my transition to Medtronic so I know how close they ran.","I switched from Medtronic to Dexcom relatively recently and have litle to no issue with adhesion with either I perhaps find the dexcom marginally better, but that could be my own ""honeymoon period"" with the new sensor (albeit it now 6 months +). I do find my mental security on the accuracy on the dexcom is significanly higher, but thats my experience, and everyone will have their own story on that!",09/22/2022,2,11
"Medicare, C-Peptide, Type 2 Pump",11/13/2021,williamtd,"I’m Type 2 and have been on a pump for years. It’s the only thing that controls my A1c. I have pump and Dexcom supplies for the next 3 months, but after that, I’ll need to get more. I haven’t seen my Endo since 2020 because I've been uninsured prior to starting Medicare a few weeks ago. The Endo I was seeing isn’t covered by my Medicare plan, so I’ll be making a new appt as well and getting re-established with a new Endo prior to attempting to get a new pump (out of warranty now) and supplies. I’ve never had a C-Peptide test before. I know that I need a C-Peptide test to qualify for a pump under Medicare. Medicare's criteria states: “…a fasting C-peptide level that is less than or equal to 110 percent of the lower limit of normal of the laboratory’s measurement method.” So, if the C-Peptide range for the specific lab I’ll be using is “0.80 to 3.85 ng/mL” does that mean that my C-Peptide would have to be less than or equal to .088 ng/mL? Lower limit of normal is “.08 ng/mL” on this range, multiplied by “.110” (110%)…would equal “.088 ng/mL.” Did I do that math correctly? Thanks for any help!","Your answer (.088) is correct but your multiplier is not (.110 is off by a decimal point, 1.10 is the correct number). I am not sure how you arrived at the correct answer. The correct calculation is: .08 X 1.10 = .088","After thinking about it, I think C peptide is a better indicator of basal insulin level just because it is metabolized more slowly than insulin. After saying this I admit I am not a doctor so I could be completely wrong.","Wouldn't ""Fasting Insulin"" include insulin from injection/infusion? That's why C-pep is used. C-pep is co-secreted by the pancreas. When you administer exogenous insulin, you're not introducing C-peptide.",11/15/2021,2,9
Navigating insurance,07/28/2022,gapapera,"We worked with Medtronic who billed the new Omnipod system (5) to pharmacy and not to durable medical devices. I am dealing with Humana and I feel like no matter how many times I say ""Look at this claim from two months ago and look at this new claim to show what is wrong..."" They do not get it. Pharmacy says talk to Medical. Medical says talk to pharmacy. I wanted to know jsut how to get these new devices billed under Durable medical devices. If anyone has any suggestions, I'd be open to it. I may call the third party vendor (CCS Medical) to see if they can assist me. If anyone has any tips about dealing with humana, I'm open to it!!","What does Medtronic have to do with OmniPod? They don't make OmniPod, Insulet does. I wasn't aware of Medtronic distributing their competitor's product (but I suppose I could be wrong).","In my case, that means my insulin is covered 100% between Medicare B and my Aetna Supplement. My infusion sets, reservoirs, and CGM sensors are also covered 100% by same. If I were to switch to Dash/Dexcom, my CGM stuff would still be 100% covered. But I'd face prescription co-pays for the Pods, and the insulin. And I'd end up in the doughnut hole probably by March of each year.",Highly doubt ccs medical will be any help unfortunately that's been my experience!,07/31/2022,3,7
Auto Mode! (670G),07/09/2018,MX Racer,"I switched to auto mode for the first time this morning. I am super psyched. Hoping this is the ""answer"" for me. I'd love to hear others experience specifically with auto mode in the Medtronic 670G pump.","Auto mode has some great advantages. The amount of the micro blouses increases if your BGs start to elevate and are suspended if your sensor predicts (not when) you are going low. However, the micro blouses max out at 0.175 /5 minutes. Accordingly, if you mis calculate your carbs, you can still go high and will need to make a manual correction.",I’m quite interested to see how responsive / aggressive / rapid it is in taming a + 225 to around 120.,"So everything went pretty well yesterday. Throughout the day when I wasn't eating, is was near perfect. I think my previous basal was artificially high and my carb ratio was off because when I ate dinner and bolus'd, I shot to 377. Manual mode on the pump went away, so I had to take a shot to get back down. I am adjusting my carb ratio today. We'll see...",07/10/2018,1,3
Medtronic 770G Target B.S.,06/21/2022,PeterPumper,"I've long been frustrated that my 770G runs too high in Auto mode, but today pretty much perfectly made my point.  I am desperately awaiting the 780G upgrade, which lowers the target point, along with other, more aggressive changes! The 770G is just to conservative. The way I see it, my A1C is about 0.5% higher due to this ""margin of safety."," A target of 120 is always better than averaging 130 or 140, but those numbers still equate to a great A1c. If you were sitting in the ER for 7 hours, that alone could cause stress and you know what stress can do to BG levels. Keep up the good work and, eventually, the 780g will be FDA approved. While politics might be a reason for the lack of FDA approval, Medtronic is not blameless. They’ve made enough mistakes on their own.",Target will still be to have average at 6.5 mmol/L = 94 mg/dL or less . what is this 140 ? Looks to me that someone is chicken to lower the set point. I would be very unhappy with such a high set point.,"Medtronic goes through cycles of this. They seem to think that they know best (such a paternalistic attitude). I remember I traded my new 515 to go back to my 512. The newer pump would not let me change the time for active insulin (it was hard coded as 4 hours). That didn't work for me and I was expected to fudge my I:C calculations to make things work. And I couldn't use the bolus wizard because of this either. They changed this back to the 'old' way in most of the subsequent pumps. I'm hopeful for you that the more people who object to this, the sooner they will fix it.",06/24/2022,3,10
Wasted Insulin,04/05/2022,Julie De Vos,Was just changing my pump site (I use a Tandem pump) and thought about how much insulin is left in the tubing and wondered how much insulin is actually left in the cartridge when I change it? How much does this cost per year when I throw the tubing away?,Sounds outrageous to me!,"I get every drop out of my reservoirs. (Medtronic - I'll let it run till it errors from lack of flow.) But I do ""waste"" about 15 units per set change with the tubing/priming.","Wow! I always knew there was some waste with tubing, but never really thought about the cumulative amount. I use omnipod, and really don’t know how to determine waste. I assume the alarm works on the same principle as the other pumps - out of insulin, pressure builds up as delivery mechanism tries to work, and then the alarm saying empty reservoir, but I have no idea how to even determine that. Certainly less than any tubed pump, given the reservoir and infusion catheter is self contained, but I would venture to guess at least 1-2 units per pod.",04/07/2022,2,15
My pump improved my time in range.,06/01/2022,zeegirl,"I'm not sure I've posted, in forever, but felt like I needed to say this to anyone who is weighing getting an insulin pump. I have a Tandem T:slim with IQ control. I resisted getting a pump, for several years, for several reasons. The main one being I didn't want something attached to my body to have to deal with daily. I had worn a Free Style Libre CGM for a long time. My numbers were up and down constantly. My daughter, finally, made me see the error of my ways and I bit the bullet and got my pump. It took some time to learn everything but I read everything I could find and am pretty comfortable with the pump now. I've changed from a Free Style Libre to a Dex Com 7 CGM because that's what Tandem uses. Just let me say that I'm over the moon with my numbers. My target glucose limit is set at 70-180. I started out with 75% as my daily time in range goal, increased it to 80% and am now at 85%. Believe it or not, my time in range ranges from 89 to 100% all the time. ","How nice to hear! Wishing you continued success with it. I sometimes resist some of the ""new-fangled"" stuff, too, though once you get the hang of something, it's usually pretty great. I'm still having a few blips with my new cell phone, but otherwise is pretty terrific.","Great. I really believe the newer technology helps with better time in range and overall control. Especially automated Insulin delivery. I have to remind myself, though to keep listening to my body and not just what the tech is telling me",Thanks for the recommendation. Glad you're getting good results : ),06/02/2022,1,16
Cracks in my Medtronic pump!,03/29/2013,craftgirl,"I am a new member to the site, but have had Type I Diabetes for 24 years. I have been on an insulin pump for about 18 years. I switched from an Accucheck Spirit Pump to Medtronic about 2.5 years ago and have been quite happy with the new technology. What I am not happy with is that my first pump developed cracks in the battery compartment. It was replaced, but after using the new pump for 2-3 months, cracks started to develop in the insulin compartment. Medtronic denies any other reports of cracks in the compartments such as I've experienced. Just wondering if anyone else out there has experienced these cracks in the plastic compartments?","I have had a Metronic pump for a time now, and they change it for me every 4 yrs. I've never had any issues with it. There was someone on here saying they had a crack in their Medtronic pump & it was replaced right away","I've had cracks in the reservoir window and by the battery opening. MM just replaced both of those pumps. But, the pump still has to be in warranty.",I too have had cracks in my battery area of my 630 which is newer pump. Called medtronic and they replaced my pump and I sent other with cracks back. Now 2 to 3 months it's happening again in battery area. I have been td1 for way over 30 years and using a pump for the last 20 years. ,03/30/2013,1,19
Magnets,04/29/2022,PeterPumper,How concerned do you all think I should be about magnets near my pump?,"Peter, I just did a quick internet search and found all sorts of warnings about keeping insulin pumps away from magnets, including some induction cooktop stoves (on JDRF).",I get training next week for the t:slim x2 and somehow did not know before my pump decision about the magnet issue. I have had Medtronic for many years. I sit with a Macbook pro 15 in. laptop in use most every day and I also sometimes wear a nametag that has strong magnets that clamp together thru clothing to hold it on.,"I've been more than satisfied with tslim! I think all pumps and cgm have this issue. For fact must be removed for mri,ct. Varying opinions on scanners at airport I take the pat down although I've gone thru them with no problem. Why have a problem when going out of town!",05/02/2022,3,17
thinking about a pump: practical questions,03/08/2022,thatguy,"I've been a LADA for 3 years now. Getting dx'd with Type 2 three years ago set in motion a new hobby of running. I'm a pretty active person, and relatively in shape. I've had an increasingly difficult time with my blood sugar levels. If I go up a unit for my background insulin (lantus), I wake up in the AM very low- sometimes the CGM- Freestyle Libre- which I know is not perfect- seems to indicate I've ""been below 40*"" for up to 3 hours. Not ideal. If I go down 1 unit, my blood sugar seems to want to be 200-250 all day, regardless of how much short acting/ Lispro I take.",Are you LADA or Type 2? That might make a difference for insurance paying for a pump.,Finding out after you wake up that your BG was in the 40's over night is not good. Im on the Dexcom G6 and I can program alarms into it for low BG. It will and has waken me due to low BG.,I've been wearing a pump on and off for over 20 years and have been running up against some of the same questions you've posted. All valid and not small. I literally LOATH a pump with tubing in the summer.,03/12/2022,4,12
Sweating and keeping infusion set on for 3 days,08/25/2020,Kgeraghty21,I’m new to pumping and having a terrible time keeping my infusion sets from falling off I’m a mailman and work 10-12 hours a day and then workout 3-4 nights after. I use the quickset and after injecting it use skin tac in the winter no issues but since summer started sets barely lasting a day and a half any recommendations and wisdom would be greatly appreciated,Wow I know that is frustrating. I don’t have issues with it - I don’t use any supplemental tape either though. Sometimes the quickset pulls away at the edges up to the plastic molding but never goes further unless I accidentally tug at it. I do trim down any hair at the infusion site but not sure if that helps anything anyways.,"Yes, I found a way to make it stick better. Clean the area very well first, then apply some rubbing alcohol and apply the inset before it completely dries. It seems to make the glue stick better. But when very active and sweaty I have used a high quality tape to cover the edges of the inset."," I put tape over my infusion sets, they stay on much better that way.",08/27/2020,2,12
FDA Approval - Omnipod 5,01/31/2022,Julie De Vos,Omnipod 5 has just been approved by the FDA and we plan on interviewing Insulet to discuss the new system.,"I was very excited to read about this, as the tubeless aspect has been the biggest thing from me pursuing a hybrid closed loop.","It would be interesting to know what target range the automatic algorithm was approved for (i.e. 130, 120, lower?).",My understanding is you can use it with certain phones basic functions or a controller. Also understand its a pharmacy item not durable medical equipment. The juice box podcast had omnipod people on explaining it.,02/04/2022,4,3
What to do about tubing,01/27/2022,skessdtrek,"So I use omnipod, but thinking about switching to tslim for control IQ, but in past (and biggest hesitancy for leaving omnipod) I had a lot of trouble with snagging the tubing. Went through forums here and didn’t see anything specifically addressing it, so thought I’d ask - how do you prevent snags from the tubing (particularly if you are clumsy like me)?","First of all, think about what length tubing you want. I happen to use a Medtronic pump, and I also use a few different types of infusion sets. But I also use different length tubing at various times. I usually use 23"" tubing. This is pretty short, and doesn't leave much to get snagged",I also use a Medtronic. I keep my pump in my pocket and find the 23” tubing to short - can’t lower my pants without removing the pump and have pulled it off the bathroom vanity many time while using the sink. I much prefer the 46” tubing which I often roll around the pump to keep it from getting snagged when walking about.,"some of the Medtronic infusion sets also come in 32"". But I know exactly what you're talking about.",01/30/2022,3,17
Omnipod problems?,05/23/2020,songdog,I was speaking with my Endo about pumps. Asked him about Omnipod. He said a number of his patients were having issues with their injection sites closing up and the pod not lasting 3 days. He said it's significant enough that he has communicated his concerns to the company. Can anyone comment?,I used it for 4 years constant occlusions nice to wear but wasn't reliable enough. Switched to tslim use steel infusion sets ( not an option with omnipod ) no problem.,I have been using them for 4 years and have had 2 PDM failures and dozens of pump failures. Tubeless feature is the only good thing about them. Weekly comm failures while priming and activating/deactivating.,"Been using omnipod for 10-11 years now. I’d estimate about 1-2% failure rate over that time (defined as any pod error which can be after wearing for any period of time, or errors that prevent actually using the pod to begin with). It doesn’t seem to have been any better or worse now compared to 10 yrs ago.",05/25/2020,2,8
Which pump,10/26/2021,Richard90,I have no issues with the 670. Nice to have something different. I am hoping the 780 will be available when my warranty ends February 20 2022. If not not then the Tslim I do have a Tslim that was my mother’s so good backup. There are things like set change that Medtronic is much faster and easier. There are several things I read I don’t like and things I do like. The 780 will have the G4 and I think calibration is once a week or no calibration. Having a hard time deciding but I have few months to decide just hate to be stuck with a pump that I don’t like for 4years ,"I;m on the 770G, patiently awaiting the 780 approval. While less calibrations will be nice, I'm more excited about a more aggressive Auto mode, lowering the Target another 10 points or so. I don't think I'll ever trust any CGM 100% anyway, despite the fact that the Guardian3 is very accurate for me.","I've used omnipod, omnipod and g4, and tslim with g5 and currently with g6. Tslim is a god fit for me. I trialled the Medtronic sensor and wasn't impressed fell off looked poorly designed","Having used Medtronic pumps since the 506 was the only option, I have just recently changed to Tandem since the smallest Medtronic pump was 1) too big, and 2) won't work with Dexcom.

"Blocked line, no delivery",11/30/2021,Lolee,I've been type 1 diabetic for 35 years and. a pump user for about 12. I've recently been getting a message on my 670 that its blocked and not delivering insulin. After some serious highs and multiple set changes a day I'm lost. Anyone have any idea why this is happening?,"What brand is your pump? That will help people here to work out if they can help or not. In the meantime, can you contact the help line for the company that made it?","Is that a Medtronic 670G? - can you contact Medtronic to discuss?

No more large reservoirs?,11/07/2021,NHCindy,"The warranty on my T:Flex is up and my pump is failing fast. I use an average of 150 units a day (Type 2). My T:Flex is able to hold 480 units. My last Medtronic pump was over 700 units (a long time ago.) The size of reservoirs available now pale in comparison. Cost wise I might as well go back to daily shots. Before pumping, I was taking 12 shots a day, so I would still prefer to pump. My options for large reservoirs are no longer an option so I am doomed to replacing pods/cartridges/reservoirs whatever I choose almost daily.","If you're taking close to 300 units a day, you probably should be considering moving to U-500 insulin.","The first Medtronic Pump was 300 units, which was the one available when I began wearing one in 1990, this was the only size reservoir available. Later when the Paradigm was an option the 180 unit reservoir became an option. ","U-500 can be used in a pump. There's no setting for it, so you just need to manually convert everything. If you want a basal rate of 5 unit/hr, you'd set the pump for 1 unit/hr if using U-500 instead of U-100. And if you want to administer a bolus of 25 units of U-500, you'd tell the pump to give you 5 units. The pump doesn't know that the fluid in the reservoir has 5 times the concentration of insulin, but you do.",11/09/2021,2,17
How to delete data from pump?,10/14/2021,HighHopes,My 670G was recalled and I got a replacement pump. I have to return the defective one. Does anyone know how to delete my info from the device?,Deleting the data really isn’t necessary. They replaced the pump. Just pull out the battery and ship it back.,"I just got a 670g replacement pump and didn’t delete data on my returning pump. However, try Options, Utilities, and Manage Settings. Once there, press the back arrow key and right arrow button simultaneously and you’ll get to the screen where you can clear data.","It’s pretty simple to remove the clip so try again.

New Member - Long Term Type 1 on Medtronic Insulin Pump,09/28/2021,DDPLady1,"If you take you blood glucose reading and divide it by the ISIG found in the Sensor prompt you will come up with a value which must fall between a certain range of numbers.

"Is the pod in the ""Experience Kit"" a real pod?",07/28/2021,SteveMann,"When I was considering the Omnipod for my insulin delivery, Insulet sent me an ""Experience Kit"" which contains a pod. The kit is supposed to familiarize the user with wearing the pod. However, I can't tell the demo pod (which I never wore) from a new one, except for the tiny word ""demo"" on the pod. Is it a usable pod?","Sorry, have no idea, but can you ask Insulet?",No according to Omnipod it has no canula or the hardware to insert it. I expect there is no innards in the demo pod ether.,The demo pod is a real pod but is NOT usable at all. It is designed to try on to see if you like the feel of it and if the adhesive causes skin issues and stay son the up to three 3 days if you want to test that. The look and the shell are exactly the same though. Hope you like it. There are several of us podders on here that can answer any questions that you might have.,07/31/2021,3,7
Pump advice Canada,04/15/2018,jodoog,"Hey, I'm sure this gets asked a lot but was hoping for some pump-choice advice.
I'm a Type 1 (23 years roughly) located in Canada and recently started using a Dexcom G5 with Xdrip+; which I'm appreciating so far (minus the interstitial delay). I've decided to go ahead with a pump as it's mostly covered here in Ontario. Really struggling trying to decide between the Omnipod, and waiting a few months for the T:Slim x2. It mainly seems to be a case of G5 integration vs tubeless but it's hard to value either given I've never used a pump before (novorapid + tresiba atm).
For those that have used either pump do you have any suggestions? Is the G5 integration on the Tandem particularly useful? The PLGS Tandem system sounds like it could be fantastic given the number of hypos I have - assuming it's ever brought to Canadian T-slims.
For reference my last HbA1c was 5.4. However I currently use a lot of insulin and an enormous amount of sugar to aggressively ping-pong my blood sugar into a 4-7 range. My insulin sensitivity seems to change significantly day-by-day; however I feel awful when my BS exits that range and try to avoid it at all costs (although it happens plenty).
Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks! :)","Before my transplant I had a medtronic pump that I loved. But last year at FFL (friends for life T1 conference) I saw so many pods I decided that when it was time to pump again that I would have a serious look at the pod.
The advice I always give is to talk to all the representatives and see who gives better service in your area. That ends up being pretty important in the long run",,,04/17/2018,2,19
I am officially a PUMPER,03/19/2018,Diabeteshealth1,"As of 1:00 today I am pumping with all my other fellow type 1 . I cried driving home, because I realized that I now have ownership of my diabetes. The 670g is great I did a lot of reading and watching Youtube to help me prepare before pump training. The strangest part is knowing that I have to shower with the sensor on me as well has the thing that attaches to the pump. Do you guys find that to be odd? I am sure I will get used to it. I like how I will know my readings very quickly and only have to test 3 times a day compared to my 10 times now. My carb to ratio is 1 unit of insulin to 13 grams of carb taking .43 units an hour.

Omnipod vs. Medtronic 670g system,03/16/2018,Jeff1318,I have been using the Omnipod system for about 8 years now but I might have to go back to a traditional pump system because of insurance coverage. I was hoping to get some pros and cons of the Medtronic 670g system compared to the Omnipods. I am really having a hard time wrapping my head around making the switch.,"If insurance won't cover omnipod for you, why are you asking? It seems like you're just looking for torture (or financial woes). I'm thinking you need to run with what insurance will cover.","m asking so that I can get as much information as I can so I can make an informed decision when I know for sure if my insurance will cover the Omnipod supplies. And if they don't cover them, how the Medtronic 670g system compares to what I've been using.","Never used an Omnipod so can’t compare them. However, I have used Medtronic products for over eight years - currently using the 670G for two months. All I can say is that it alarms a lot and requires five or six BG tests a day.

Medtronic 670g cgm,03/01/2018,Diabeteshealth1,Is anyone on here the Medtronic 670g with the sensor? Im asking because I will be on it soon and was wondering if you felt the cgm was accurate with the blood glucose machine? Also how many times a day do you test to see if the numbers are accurate?,"I have been using the 670g for about thirty days. You should search for the 670g as there are several threads that discuss this product.

In theory, you should only be required to do a BG test every twelves hours. However, there are situations where you need to do additional BG testing. Apparently. The FDA requires that you need to do a BG test if you remain under 120 for 2.5 hours. There also seems to be other situations for which a BG test is required to remain in auto mode. For some reason I had to do 3 BG test within an hour today.

I average 4 to 5 BG tests a day.",I have read the threads about the medtronic 670g and none of them discuss the CGM. If you care to tell me how the CGM rates with a machine test as in are they equal the majority of the time it would help me in timing when I would like to test my blood sugar versus going with what the CGM states it to be.,"I've been using the 670G for about three months, in manual mode. Generally, I test three times per day, vs. a dozen or more times per day prior to the Guardian sensor. I find it to be extremely accurate, but you need to keep in mind that it is 30 minutes or more behind your current BGL. You also need to be careful to only calibrate when your BGL is not changing rapidly.",03/02/2018,1,4

Hard to lose weight on the pump?,03/05/2018,millie275,Is it hard to loose weight on the pump? What adjustments need to be made to loose weight? Im guessing the basal will go down as well as total amount of bolus as you eat less? But trial and error the first time?,Hi Millie I think it depends on total dose per day.,"A pump is just a tool. Some folks gain weight, because they see a pump as an ""easy out"", and just eat more and press buttons. Some lose weight, but only because the tool gives them more control and flexibility.

One thing a pump does do is allow you to be more spontaneous regarding exercise and/or food restriction. If, for example, you suddenly decide to go for a longer walk than normal, you can cut your basal rate temporarily. And, if a more vigorous session than normal makes you even more insulin-sensitive for a while, you can also reduce or even suspend insulin delivery, rather than treating a hypo or near-hypo with carbs. Likewise, if you decide to eat less, and if it drives you low despite your best basal testing, you can also cut your basal for a while.

I've been on a pump for 5 years, and a CGM for almost 3 years, and I'm just now getting into the habit of cutting my basal if I see my Ng heading towards the low end of my range. Old habits (reaching for a small snack or swig of OJ) are hard to break.

I don't look at it as a pump helping to lose weight, so much as I look at MDI as making it very difficult. The way I see it, the pump just brings us back to a level playing field. From there, it's the same hard work as for everyone else out there. But, after years of fighting an uphill battle, it sure is nice to be fighting on that level field.","I agree with what Peter is saying. If you use your pump as an easy way to eat all and everything, then you would put on weight. Without a doubt it is easy to go for seconds with a pump as you just do some more button presses and eat away. It is also easy to reach for a snack.

However, for me the pump has helped me maintain my weight. When I first started on insulin using MDI I could not bolus small enough for what I wanted to eat, so I would end up having to eat a bit more to cover the 0.5 unit which was the smallest amount a demi-pen would allow. With my pump if I want to eat something that only requires 0.1u then that is what I have.

As Peter says the pump is just another tool for delivering your insulin and it is up to you how you are going to use it.",03/09/2018,4,20
Medtronic's Priority Access Problems,03/13/2018,DH,"For the last 2 1/2 months I been told the new 670G was being shipped to me that week and as today its no where in site! Dealing with Medtronic's is like dealing with a use car lot to honor a warranty it provided. I have heard every excuse and reason why its not here to me. Then you read a statement by the company that all Priority access customers will have their new pumps by the last week in February to add insult to injury.
Sorry, letting off stream about them but, I was wondering anyone else is going thru this problem with them. The local Medtronic's trainer has done everything he could to find out when it will be ship but no luck. My Doctor has offer to call the company to find out what is their problem but I told him to wait until my next appointment if I haven't received it by then. I have been told all Priority Access customers will get their pump before new orders get theirs....which is hard to believe.
Let me know if you or someone you know is going through the same problem.

DH","I got my 630 in February, 2017 and started calling for availability on the 670 upgrade the following September. And called semi monthly thereafter. In November, I was told that production problems following the hurricane in Puerto Rico were holding up the upgrade orders. In late November, I was told that all priority upgrade back orders would be shipped by year end. I finally got mine In early February 2018.","Thanks Don
I wouldn't mine waiting so much if they said the truth about the delays. To me that is not a good way to keep customers. The FDA and Medicare, and other companies are coming out with products that do the same and most likely a little better. The government is moving faster than ever on new drugs and equipment for diabetes than ever. In the mean time I will wait for the pump or until something better comes out.

I'm not sure you can doing or not doing this every time, but occasionally it happens. So don't assume that it won't happen.

As far as cleanup goes, if it happened at work, mop up what you can and then let the janitorial staff cleanup the rest. I'm not sure what else you can do. Rinsing you clothes in cold water will help get the blood out- that's all I know. And to always be prepared with a paper towel.

Setting basal tricky?,02/10/2018,CalgaryDiabetic,"A least in theory you should be able to set your basal so you stay in the normal range 70 to 110 between meals. Well I set mine at somewhere close to 3 units/hr and sometimes I go low and most of the time above 130. Since 130 to 150 is a lot less unpleasant than low I leave it at that and correct a bit. after correction I go low sometimes. I am not sure what changes from day to day I know food: composition and CALORIES do matter, sleep, exercise all have effects and God only knows what else: for instance gum infection. when I started pumping I did better with an average of 7 mmol/L i.e. 125 and with a variance that was only that you would expect from the meter. When I first got the pump I may have been more more careful about food and eating a bit less calories.

This would be the ideal application for closed loop control. My pump does not allow for that. Will be entitled to exchange it for medtronics 630 (when the Animas supplies are no longer available)which I think doesn't do that. Maybe for more money I could get more advanced medtronics with some feedback control.

What do you pump magicians think ?","CD I hear you loud and clear. My basal challenges occur during the night. Even though my 640G (& maybe the 603?) isn't closed loop, at least it does suspend basal if approaching a low. As lows are my main problem, I love this feature.

I now have my night time basal set to 0.5. With my old Veo some days I would wake up perfect and other I'd wake with a nasty hypo. I'd often have to make a judgement call before going to bed as to whether I'd have to drop it to 0.45 or even lower, depending upon how the day had been panning out.

Now with my 640G I wake up refreshed & rested and can often see that my basal got suspended & then restarted while I slept on blissfully unaware.","CD, how many basal rates do you have? I had 3. My highest was from midnight to 6 am, lowest from 6 am to 11 am and then the mid range one from 11 am to midnight. But my insulin sensitivity was pretty stable. What were the results of your basal testing and do you think it's time to do a it more testing? I hated checking the overnight levels getting up every hour or two. Skipping meals for half the day was less of a deal for me to figure out my daytime rates.

Cora","Thank you Caraline, this is good to know that basal is very touchy, same with me but at a 6 times rate a 10% change in basal has massive effect. suspend and restart is a great feature one can then be much more aggressive with basal without waking up because of a nasty low. So 640 G. I am not sure our health care covers CGM sensors and tax deduction for medical supplies is next to useless. I will ask medtronics what they charge for CGM sensors and what the capital cost is also.

After 20 years with less than perfect BG control I have not had any complications so maybe I am not that susceptible. I know the logic of that is imperfect.",02/13/2018,3,12
Bolus wizard,02/17/2018,bradpollina,"So I went back to my CDE Thursday and as promised, she went over all the menus of the 630G pump.

We turned on the BOLUS wizard, and she said it is a work in progress and that I can call any time for adjustments.
Based upon my Dexcom #s, she set it at Carb ratio of 5, ISF 15 and 100-120 low high and active insulin time at 4 hours. My current basal is 2 units per hour.

For carbs, I'm using One Drop's food library to calculate carbs (my choice. I actually love it!).

Do you recommend that I test via finger stick to put in the BG level at each meal, or should I just leave that blank? She said if I put a BG level in there, it would take my current level into account and adjust accordingly so I don't go too high or low.

For now she wants me to work on consistency and not going low and to use the wizard as much as I can.

So far I've been doing ok staying around 140 but occasionally it goes a bit high. I go back in about 4 weeks.

We also covered the waves, and she said square was for extended boluses over time like for Pizza and that the dual wave was 2 separate boluses split up over

I'm also on Bydurion BCISE weekly. Having fun on the prior authorization merry go round but once that's approved, it wont cost me anything (nor will my insulin and all diabetic products btw so long as I stay on the preferred list like Humalog vs Novolog anyway).

I also asked about type 1.5 vs 2 and was told that so long as I'm still producing ANY insulin that I would be a type 2. But she did say that if I ever became a type 1 I could still continue my Bcise because it helps with both 1 and 2 so not a whole lot would change for me.",Not sure I agree at all with he definition 1.5 even some type 1 produce some insulin.,"Oh, I'm sure I disagree with the CDE.

As T1 is an Auto-immune disorder, whether sudden, or slow onset, and T2 is not AI, one does not go from T2 to T1, period.

Not to beat a dead horse, but I really believe you should not just ""let this go"", because, moving forward, the difference between a proper T1 diagnosis and not can have a major impact with various insurance coverages, especially eventual Medicare. And if you think it's difficult to get the proper classification now, it certainly will only be more difficult as time goes by.","As far as testing before using the Wizard, yes, the Wizard works best if you can enter your current Bg. When you do, it can build a correction (positive or negative, depending on if you are above or below your target range) into the calculations.

Also, your 630G should have come with a Next Link meter. This is where the radio link of the Next Link is so nice. It just sends the Bg value right to the pump, right into the Wizard. Yes, it's just a matter of saving a few seconds, but time savers like that sure encourage actually testing each time.

When you don't test, the Wizard leaves the Correction portion out. In essence, it assumes your Bg is right where you want it, and calculates, as best it can, to return your Bg right to where it is at the moment, PP. In essence, you've just skipped an opportunity to correct.",02/19/2018,2,11

Can the sensor be stuck in the stomach area ?","Actually, the abdomen is the recommended placement for the Medtronic CGM's (Enlite/Guardian 3).","	""That is good news. I am changing my opinion on the usefulness of CGM in my case since they seem to be getting more accurate and could be good for slight adjustments of basal at night to permit normal BG without lows that often. I am not sure I will be able to ever set basal correctly in an open loop situations there are too many intangible variables. The same for food many times I wait 1 hour see what the BG is and then inject. Measure at 2 hours and inject more if need be.

PS: Sorry for posting this I should have realized that the author was bizzare.

Any insight with medtronic or other companies would be awesome.","Well, if you won't use a CGM, then NO pump will help with the hypo unawareness.
And without a CGM, as far as Mdtronic, you're talking about a 630G, because anything beyond that is all about the CGM and Auto mode. In fact, if you can get your hands on a cheap second-hand older Medtronic pump, that would work, too (assuming you can get someone to support it enough to at least write scripts for the supplies).",I cannot afford CGM the cost of it compared to pump supplies is at least double even with insurance. Not to mention it uses up space i would rather save for my pump infusions.,"Just for the sake of discussion: If I were dealing with hypo-unawareness (to a further degree than I already do), and I had limited resources, I would spend my money on the CGM (be it Medtronic or Dexcom or even Libre 2) an go back to MDI.",01/29/2021,4,14
Anyone on Tresiba?,11/25/2020,DGIrl,"I went to my PCP about my blood sugars and she wants me to try Tresiba instead of Levemir. Has anyone made this transition? Did it help you out much? I have gained 12 pounds since being on insulin for a few months!!!! I am eating low carb less than 50 on most days, less than 30 on some. I have never gained 10 pounds in even a year!!! I am hoping this will help me. I think the short acting insulin is what is causing the weight gain. I used to be vegetarian, so I like my carbs. Getting down to this much is a huge effort for me.",Wonder if any of these conversations would help while you are waiting for responses?,"You can put on weight even with 50g of carb a day. As well as carbs, you need to watch your protein for weight gain. For a female on low carb, they say 1.25-1.5 g per kg of lean body weight. Or about 75g of protein a day for most females and min 50g. You may need to square wave or split bolus, up to 50% of what a carb ratio would be. Fats aren't so limiting and use what you need for the calories. You posted in the pump forum, so I assume you are late onset T1. T2 bolus would be more relaxed and the basal and natural output may cover most of the protein and fats.","I’ve had T1 and been injecting insulin for 46 years. I’ve used many different basal insulins: NPH, Lantus, Levemir and now Tresiba. None of them have caused me to gain weight.

Site change day,12/23/2020,GrammaBear,For a very long time I have experienced high blood sugars on 'site change day'. I have experimented with many different approaches and also I have tried many different infusion sets. I currently use a steel needle infusion set from Tandem called TruSteel. I was wondering if anyone else ever encountered this same situation and what you have tried successfully or unsuccessfully to solve it?,"My sites just go bad. I don’t fight them, I just change them. It would be handy if we could see under our skin and determine what makes them bad, but we can’t. So it’s just easier to change them and move on.","A couple weeks back my midsection just needed a break from infusion sets. So I moved them to the back of my arm. They kick easily for me there, but my midsection just needed time off.","So I use the trusteel also and have same problem.

Right after I did I noticed the site area was a little wet and I smelled insulin. My pump never gave me any alarms that anything was wrong with the site. I am guessing all I need to do is change it and try again?,"When in doubt, change it out. This is the infusion set mantra.
If you can smell insulin, change it out.",I've never had one leak but have heard of it! I use the tru steel infusion sets!,"Sorry this is late but yes change the infusion set.

Temp Basal with Control IQ on Tandem,10/08/2020,glentrobfc,"Is it reasonable for times when activity demands a different basal rate for a period of say 1 to 2 hours to set up multiple personal profiles as duplicates of your normal profiles modified with X percentage values for each basal time and all else the same. e.g., norm, norm80, norm70, etc. That way, I believe you could keep control iq safely preventing lows while still having a temp basal in effect. Then just choose the relevant profile as needed by conditions.","Welcome to DD - what you suggest sounds pretty complicated to me, but I don't use a pump.","It is actually not hard to do. You duplicate your 'Normal' profile, and then edit basal rates in each time entry of the new profile (typically 3 or 4 entries) with the new value [example: old value * .7 = new value for norm70], and save each entry.
Then when you want to use a 70% basal you activate norm70. An example of usage is when taking a long duration stressful hike, such as a Colorado Fourteener; 8 to 15 miles at altitudes above 10,000' and lasting 5 to 8 hours.",Perhaps you will get responses from those that use a pump,10/12/2020,4,18
Novolin R in pump? Anyone...,07/26/2020,She ra,"Has anyone used the older insulin in their pump? I have used Novolin R for meal time injections without issue, to me it worked like the more expensive rapid insulin's.

Is being waterproof important for patch pumps?,05/04/2020,loz88888888,"Hi All - I am looking at two different patch pumps, the omnipod and the Roche accu-check. The Roche pump is not waterproof as it needs air to fuel its zinc air batteries, but I do like the ability to be able to detach it from its base (so theoretically no need to be waterproof). How has everyone found the waterproof feature of the omnipod? I guess i am asking is it better to have to wear it all the time (omnipod), or have the flexibility to take it off but if you forget you risk breaking it (Roche)",I'm not certain what your asking exactly but I use the tslim and have used the omnipod too. Either will work i really like the tslim just detach and go. I found that the omnipod occluded often for me.,"I want to use a patch pump, so would be interested on your thoughts on the omnipod... What i am trying to ask is would it have annoyed you if you had to take the omnipod off each time you showered / swam (if it was detachable from the cannula). That is basically what the Roche product is doing in Europe since it isnt waterproof you have to detach it from the base (you dont have to reinsert the cannula every time, just click the pump/battery portion back in)",The only thing about the omnipod is you can only get one type and angle of infusion set. I need a steel one that's my main reason for going to tslim while that and now it has a semi automated program to it. Detaching battery wouldn't be a problem for me.,05/05/2020,1,8

Omnipod training tomorrow...suggestions?",11/05/2018,bradpollina,"Tomorrow I'm getting trained on my Omnipod by my diabetic educator.
I've already had formal training on my 630G from Medtronic, so looks very similar.
I've already programmed it myself and have been using it for a few weeks or so, and so far 
I don't have any questions other than needing help figuring out locations and making sure I'm 
inserting it right. I've also noticed that the canula seems to be a bit wider/bigger, so it tends to cause sore spots?
I also don't like that with the amount of insulin I have to take, I have to change it every 2 days.
Any suggestions as to what I should ask her that maybe I'm not thinking of?","i never took the training, i would like to know why the math doesnt add up correctly on how much insulin is left.. example by the pdm i will have used 160ish units by the end of the cycle, yet it will show 9 or 10 units or low","I can't speak for the OmniPod specifically, but did you account for any insulin used to ""prime"" the pod? Also, on my Medtronic pump, there's always about 10 units left when the staus says Zero. I assume it's a safety margin of error.","Training went well. My trainer downloaded the report and said I'm using 200 units, which includes priming waste, about every 1.5 days, so she had my doc's nurse call in a dosage change to 1 pod per day. Insurance had no problems with that at all. I think it is only 200 vs 300 units because it is big enough of a pod. 300 would make it even larger! I love how it's all self contained.

Calling their ""customer support"" for anything is a total waste of time. You'll be on the phone for a minimum of 30 minutes and your problem will absolutely not be resolved on the first try even if you are certain everything was taken care of.

Here in Australia I have found Metronic tech support excellent. I've never had to wait more than a couple of minutes to get through and though accents & fuzzy lines can making communication a bit difficult, I've always had my problem resolved.

Having said that, were you trying to go through tech support to purchase a pump, or did you have a pump with a problem?

If it was to organise purchase, I doubt tech support would be the right place to go. Can you get your DE to do the ground work for you?","All I can tell you is that is 100% opposite of my experience with Medtronic the past 5 years.

While calls can take some time (they are very thorough in documenting everything), I really can't recall them ever failing to resolve an issue with the first call.

For instance, the end of last year I called because the little rubber bumper sticker on the end of my 530G had come off. I was just hoping they'd send me a new bumper to stick on, as it is a nice protection for the motor in case of incidental drops. However, they actually apologized and explained that they needed to replace the entire pump (which was under warranty).

I've also had my fair share of CGM sensors replaced that didn't last the entire six days, regardless of why. Every time they've been friendly, helpful, and yes, very thorough.

Since reusing the infusion set, I experienced Difficulty keeping my BGs below 200 even using a number of bolus corrections. I also noticed that I was using just over100 units of insulin a day instead of my usual 65 units.

My question is whether the high BGs were most likely due to keeping the infusion set in place for a second three days or more likely due to my cold?n","Infusion sets don’t last forever. Do a correction dose with a syringe. If it lowers your number, the infusion set is done. When in doubt, change it out. But it also sounds like you have nothing to change it out to.","Yes, keeping the infusion set in that long causes blood glucose to rise. To reuse an infusion set, you pull it out after 3-4 days, put it in somewhere else and stick the canula fitting down with adhesive tape. That way you can get another 3-4 days use out of it.

Medtronic is in the process of replacing a defective reservoir but is currently out of stock of individual reservoirs. Does anyone know if I can refil the old reservoir to hold me over until my new supply is received?",I have an animas ping and do refill reservoirs on occasion. I pump at least 75 units/day so one fill does not last long.,"I think it's okay to re-use it. Not for a long long time or too many times though, the O-ring will likely degrade. Hope your new order gets to you soon, don.","I get just over two days out of a full 300 unit reservoir. I use Quick-set infusion sets, which are good for 3 days. Most of the time I refill the reservoir once, and use a set for a combined 4 days, then use a fresh set & reservoir. I've never had a problem.

In faxt, since a vial holds 1000 units, and after three fills, there's still 100 units left, if I'm having a particularly cooperative set, I sometimes will use that last 100 units by refilling the reservoir again, using the set for almost five days. But I try not to make a habit of that.

Pump question,10/19/2018,,"Hi, I was just diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, but I'm not insulin dependent yet, for the time being, meds have been working.

I know technology has come along way, but I know nothing about insulin pumps. Can a pump read your blood sugar and deliver insulin automatically? If that's a ridiculous question, forgive me. I know you can wear a sensor on your arm instead of sticking your finger, so I'm wondering if somehow the sensor/reader can work automatically with the pump.

Thanks for any input.

Lisa","You can pair up a pump and CGM to work together and use your Iphone with apps to have a system of both delivery, reporting/recording showing patterns. THe CGM can be set with thresholds with alarms for both high and low BG. Your pump can only use rapid acting insulin and you can set your basal to delivery x amount of unit(s) per hour and use it to deliver bolus for meals but that part of it you need to do manually. others here on forum can provide you more specifics on best pumps/cgm and the details using them. I elected to bypass a pump and use MDI as it works best for me","Since you have LADA, your ins plan should cover your pump and CGM/sensors but you may have co pymt/deductible. but right now your not on insulin so this is something you can research for a later date. you may want a Libre to monitor your BG, cheaper and easy to use or use a simple blood glucose meter and strips,

Do you have a name for your pump?,09/05/2018,,"Do you name your pump? I usually don't but in kidding around with my husband, mine is called Elizabeth. That was my mother in-law's name and at times it just won't hush. It reminds me of everything that is wrong in my life, lol. It tells me that I reported a high 3 hours ago and took insulin for it and wants to know what is my blood sugar now. It also reminds me when to calibrate the CGM & change out my pump every 3 days and my CGM every 7 days. When i am low, it tells me to go eat carbs, test and retest. I think the name is quite fitting for it, lol.",If i did i would called it Exxon,"Mine is called G4, rather obvious since it's a tandem t:slim G4. I call my Dexcom sensor, Dexi. I know I'm not real original about the names.","I received my first pump when Medtronic was Mini Med so my pumps over the years were called Mini or Mini Me.

Pump question,07/04/2018,,I have a 11 year old daughter that has been on a Medtronics 530G for 4years now and it is time for replacement. What pump would be a good replacement? I like the 670G because of the auto basel function but then you have all the BG checking to do and all the alarms that people are talking of. Has anyone tried the T:slim X2 with the Dexcom G6 sensor? Looks like this would work and supposedly you don't have to check your BG for ten days. Be interested in what you have to say. Thanks,"I'm using the tSlim now, with the G5, and love it. The G6 support and auto basal shutoff isn't out yet, but is coming (supposedly in August). When it's released it'll be a software upgrade, so if you're interested it might not be a bad idea to start the insurance dance now.",Can you make an appointment with a pump trainer to check out the systems you're interested in? I feel better when I can see stuff instead of just reading about it. I'm in the exact same position as your daughter (currently using the 530G)...meeting w/ a pump trainer on Monday to look at options.,Which do you like? And which can your doctor easily support? Go with that one :),07/05/2018,1,19
Tandem Cartridges,08/29/2018,,"Has anyone discovered an adapter for the Tandem pumps, I'm using the G4, so you can use a luer-lock infusion set with the t:lock cartridge?
I'm wondering because I really like using the Cleo 90 infusion set. I found a box of the old cartridges so I was able to get a box of the Cleo's. Now, I want more. But I don't have any more cartridges. Can anyone help?","Try calling Tandem and see what they say. Who makes the Cleo? Call that company also. I am not positive that tandem cartridges are leur lock. They look like it, but I have not tried a leur lock syringe to make sure. It has to be 100% right or you risk leaking insulin and rising blood sugars.","Tandem used to make the leur lock cartridges, then they switched to the horrible t:lock ones. I figured I'd try here before calling tandem. I've had problems with the company who makes the cleos so I really don't want to talk with them again.

My husband is working on making an adapter himself.","A great idea in theory but insulin pumps are a continuous flow system so any sort of adapter would always have to be changed with the cartridge and tubing to maintain that flow (i.e you would need alot of adapters, not just one). I would imagine with a new adapter for every change you would have an issue of maintaining that flow without air bubbles etc. unless you flushed out the adapter every time.....",08/31/2018,2,15
Scar Tissue,07/05/2018,,I have been on the pump (minmed) for around 18 years. I used my stomach and legs. Now I am moving to my back of my legs. I really don't want to use my arm. How to you heal up Scar tissue,Good question all i have used was my stomach. At 37 years I am now to the very sides.,I have the same problem. About 15 yrs or so with the pump and now the cgm also in my stomach. I try to always rotate from one hip to my stomach to the other side of my stomach to the other hip and start again. Still it is hard finding a place sometimes. I've tried on my thighs and it hurt and got rubbed all day long. I do NOT want to do that again or on my arms since it will show!,"I guess i am the odd one, as when i place anything below my waistline in front, I bleed. It comes out on the tape and gets wet so the tape falls off within minutes of placing it. My cgm does the same thing. I use my hips toward my back, the area above my waist line and my upper legs. I do place my dexcom sensor on my upper arm at times, also and only on my right arm. I have lots of scar tissue on my left arm due to many repeated surgeries there.",07/08/2018,3,8
Omnipod,08/05/2018,,"Talk me into it or out of it.
Been a type 1 for 22 years now and never had a pump. Omnipod is really the only one I am interested in, because of the simplicity of it with no tubes, and a added bonus of it being the cheapest one I have found. I currently use a freestyle Libre and working on really getting everything under control and figured with a pump it would be even better once it was figured out and dialed in.
6.7 a1c 8/2",Having a pump and a CGM has helped me. I am type 1 and have been on an insulin pump since 1983 and a CGM for just over a year. Have you asked for the demo pod yet? It is just a nonworking pod that you can put on for a couple of days to see if it may be right for you. The lines don't bother me a bit. Do you have insurance that will help pay for It? Check with them before deciding what you want as some insurances will pay for one and not the other. Good luck and let us know what you decide to do.,Having a pump and a CGM has helped me.

My newTandem pump and Dexcom G5 CGM,08/15/2018,,"I recieved my new T-Slim pump last week to pair with my Dexcom G5. Wow, this is an improvement for me!! This is the first time in years that I don't have 2 pockets full of medical devices, it seems. I actually have less in one as the pump/CGM combo is much smaller than my Medtronic 723. It is almost self explanatory with it's touch screen. When i don't have a pocket, such as at night, I just pin a baby sock to my gown and slip it in the sock at the neckline. No need for another expensive case to buy. My blood sugars have improved since getting it. I didn't think that was possible since I already had the CGM. It seems to be working better together. The color touch screen is a nice improvement with CGM graph running across it. It also will allow me to check the bolus calculations, if it seem too high or low. You see the IOB, blood sugar, basal rate,volume left in the cartridge, pattern that your bs is headed, and much more at a glance of the home screen. The only problem I ran up against was the on/off button on top of the unit is difficult to push with the case they supplied. The nurse-educator that will be coming out on Thursday afternoon said she would see what else is offered. My husband who could set up and place my pump and cgm before I changed to this seems a little hesitant to touch it, but he will know how in time. I left the metal cannula in almost 5 days prior to changing it out. 300 cc's of insulin lasted that long for me and I decided to change it out at the same time. I was not at all tender at the site with that amount of time and will push it a little further with this set up. I couldn't be any happier with this right now and will post if that changes.",Well that’s good news for you!,I did a trial run at the friends for life conference last month. The button on top is hard to push in they told me it was the case and it would break in. It did seam easier toward the end of the trial. Glad to hear you like it. Do you mean the g6?,"No, I got the G5 as my Dexcom was over a year old and I am on Medicare. Yes, in ways we are treated like second class citizens. My insurance with a supplement costs me almost $600 a month.

Omnipod demo kit 2018,08/29/2018,,"Hi all ,
just ordered the omnipod demo kit .Could any one tell me if after the 3 days the pod demo needs to be sent back and if so is shipping free .","Hi, Lollypopto. I ordered a demo kit 2 months ago. It contained a nonworking pod. There was nothing to send back. It is really a good time to try it. If you live in the USA, it's really hot now and I found that it was not a good fit for me, as I sweated it off, lol. Lots of people love them, but I ended up going with Tandem. Good luck and I wish you the best. Will this be your first pump? If not, what are you replacing. I have been on several Medtronics and a few Animus, but never an Omni Pod or Tandem.","You stick the pod on your body, wear it for a couple of days to see if you have issues with the device or the adhesive. Then like any pod (working or not working) you peel it off and throw it away.

So if you’re done with it, just throw it away.","You HAVE wipe the area with an alcohol pad and let it dry before applying the pod (I also shave the area) when I do that Ive never had a pod get loose. sweating, swimming, riding a bicycle...",09/01/2018,3,4
Another Question Regarding Tandem T-Slim Pump,07/25/2018,,"I should get my new pump by Friday, or Monday at the latest. In a situation like I had tonight with my Medtronrc 723 pump.... I changed my set out this morning and filled with 300 cc of insulin. I have been fighting with hyperglycemia ever since. I tried exercising to get the blood flowing better, drinking liquids, extra bonuses to the point of stacking. Nothing seemed to help. My site felt a little tender, so I decided to start a new set-up. I took a new infusion set, and only added back the insulin I used and changed everything out. I can often use that much insulin in 3 days, but sometimes I get an extra full day with it. With the Tandem pump, would the 260 units of insulin be wasted that was left from the set-up this morning? Can I use that reseviour for the second set up in less than 12 hours, or is there a way to get that insulin out of that reseviour? I can not afford to waste insulin. Right now I am in the Medicare gap and having to pay for all my meds. That already takes more than I bring in each month. I am going with the metal infusion set with the new pump. My cannula was bent tonight when I got it out to examine.","You don't have to change the reservoir when you change the infusion set. Use the reservoir until it is empty. I change infusion sets and reservoirs independently. I refill reservoirs 4 or 5 times before throwing it out, so they last about a month. I also reuse steel cannula infusion sets.","I swap sites every 2-3 days, but only swap cartridges when they're empty (typically 8-9 days).

So a cartridge will last 3-4 sets. Got in this habit with my Spirit pump with no issues, and continue with the Tandem.","Thanks for the replies. I find that the Medtronic cartridge leaks pretty good if used for more than 3 days. I tried talking to the company about going around smelling like insulin all the time, and came to the conclusion that they had no answers. And when there is no answers......There is no money. Welcome to my world of Tandem pretty soon!!",07/27/2018,2,14
replacement pump,08/26/2018,,"I got a replacement for my Animas Vibe pump today. After 3 years of use I was having difficulty reading the screen. I thought my sight was deteriorating. But at the diabetes clinic I was told that the pump was not working properly and should be replaced. The new Vibe arrived at my home in a remote New Zealand town the next day. Works much better and should last me at least another 3 years. This is the first time I have asked for assistance with the pump, and I am very impressed.",That's great! We're you having problems with your b's with the other pump?,"Not really. But I was not able to bolus when outside because I could not see the screen well enough. So I expect some improvement when active outside. I couldn't tell the time either, which was even more frustrating! The company with the New Zealand Animas agency also handles Medtronic, and it is good to see they are still looking after Animas customers.",,08/29/2018,3,6
Medtronic 670 Too Expensive!,06/11/2018,,"Has anyone else using a Medtronic 670 pump run into them being crazy expensive to use? We knew they were costly but seems like they are to expensive to even own?
Thinking of sending mine back and switching back to the needles, alot cheaper to use.
Not to mention the constant beeping and loss of sleep from the thing always needing calibration!
Just looking for a few different ideas.","If you are on a Medicare Group Advantage plan, It will cover the pump but not cover a Continuous Glucose Monitor System.","I am on regular Medicare and a supplement and all pumps are now covered, I have been pumping for a very long time and have not ever had any out of pocket costs. My health improved when I started pumping around 34 years ago. I have a CGM now and my a1c is improving with that, also. When you get comfortable with wearing a pump & CGM you will start to fine tune it, and some of those alarms will go away. There is absolutely nothing wrong with MDI, either. It`s all in what you are most comfortable with. Good luck in whatever you decide to do. Please post back as I am interested in what you decide to do.","I don't know that Medtronic systems are any more expensive than other brands.

For example, the only two true CGM systems, Dexcom and Medtronic, are pretty much the same as far as costs. Some save with Dex by reusing their sensors longer, but that is ""off-label"". And, even at that, the transmitters for Medtronic are rechargeable, and may prove cheaper than Dexcom's over their life cycle. So, all in all, they're pretty even.

As far as pumps, they all have significant up front costs. I don't know if any current brand (Medtronic, Tandam, Insulet) are significantly cheaper than the others. The same goes for the supplies, such as infusion sets, reservoirs, or Pods.

Again, are you commenting on Medtronic in particular, or on the costs associated with Pumping and CGM's in general?",06/12/2018,1,7
Opinions please,07/20/2018,stew7428,"d a new insulin pump thru tandem about a week ago. What is their process to send it after insurances are verified? Does all this go pretty quickly? My supply company has called to verify next month's order and I really don't want to run out, but don't want to delay getting supplies for the new one either. I hope I made the right decision when going with tandem. It was between them and omni-pod. My hubby was 100% for tandem and I was torn between the two. I know that I am the one wearing i, but after 44 years of marriage, you talk things thru. I have scheloderma and have decided that it is time for the metal canulas instead of the plastic. I have not been using an insertor or metal cannula with my Medtronic, but I am having more frequent bent infusion sets. I would love no tubing, but need the metal at this time in my life. Maybe in another 5 years, that will be an option. Thanks for reading my long post and would appreciate your opinions, please.",Currently use mdi. Tried the tslim for two days at the friends for life conference last week. Very likely going to get one at end of the year. Very impressed! The steel set is the one I tried was very comfortable. I agree they won't bend and should give a full length of time! Too bad omni pod only has one type of canula. They also are great to use and work with.,"Thanks furball and Red fan. I am excited and can't wait for it to come in. Anyone wanting an insulin pump these days will have to have a C-Peptide and fasting glucose under 200 on the same day to satisfy most insurances, including Medicare. I have an old one but had lots of trouble running it down. I had 2 docs that have retired by now. Luckily, records were forwarded on to my PCP. I thought the endo would have it, but didn't. I thought I would mention that, hopefully it will help someone along the way. Anyone remember their results?

Pump failures,07/05/2018,Sarirb1,To my freinds on pumps. Today I woke up with my CGM showing a normal glucose. Changed my infusion site went for a two mile walk. Blood glucose quickly rose to 250 despite my usual breakfast. This will happen about every 3 months and usually indicates that the pumps catheter is bent. It can then take most of the day ho get my sugar down. Does this happen to ogher pump users? Is there any way to prevent it? Would Fiasp or an insulin other than my Humalog help?,"I was having issues with any type of cannulas. Decided 5 years ago to switch to steel needle infusion sets and no issues except the usual site gets sore but less Highs
",If your cannula is bent then it indicates you have the wrong length/size or you need to try a different type or angled cannula. No change of insulin will help with a bent cannula.,"I don't think the OP is talking about tubing, but the part that is inside you.

Hot tub!,02/24/2020,Red fan,So I use the tslim with true steel infusion sets and will be using a hot tub for about three days wondering if the insulin in the tube will effect my bg? Any experience would be helpful!,You're going to make that insulin 20+ degrees hotter than it's designed to be. Expect odd results afterwards.,Agree with Bountyman. I don't remove my pump for pools or other calm bodies of water. Always for a hot tub because I've assumed it can't be good for the insulin (or the pump).,"Pump would be off, the tru steel infusion set has an anchor and separate steel canula with about four inches of tubing connecting them.

"Medtronic MiniMed 670G system",02/05/2020,jeff1318,I have been on the Omnipod system for 10 years. I recently moved to Idaho and the state Medicaid does not have a provider that deals with the Omnipods. I am going to have to switch to a traditional pump.

The information will be greatly appreciated.,"I have used Medtronic pumps (currently on 670 G) for eight years and never had an issue with the pumps and always got good service from Medtronic.

Before that, I had MDIs for almost 20 years. I used Dexcom G5 CGM for about 2 years prior.
